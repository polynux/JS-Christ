# JS-Christ
This is a bot written in js with [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) for [discord](https://discordapp.com).

## Dependencies
You need to have installed [nodejs](https://nodejs.org). All other dependencies will be downloaded automatically.

## Pre-install

You have to create a bot on [discord/developers](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/). Google-it there are many tutorial online for that. Create also an app on [https://developers.giphy.com/](https://developers.giphy.com/). Once it's done, you need to create a realtime database on [firebase](https://firebase.google.com). It's free. Search on google for this. You just have to create a project on it.

## Installation
Go to your project directory, open the terminal of your choice and enter `git clone https://github.com/polynux/JS-Christ`
Once it's done, `cd JS-Christ` and write `npm install`.
After that you need to rename **config-example.json** to **config.json** in config folder . In here you have to put your **userId** from discord, your discord-bot **token**, your **giphyToken** if you want to use gif, and in firebase_config put your firebase database **apiKEY** and replace <YOUR_PROJECT_ID> with the corresponding id from firebase.
